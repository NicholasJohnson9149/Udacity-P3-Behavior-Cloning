Overview

This repository contains Nicholas Johnson's Udacity files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

### UPDATEED Submission Notes
The best video is now run1.pm4 and the model that I used to create it was clone.py which is the same as the nvidia.py other than not having teh generator fucntion to beakup data. It was working in my first submision but in mesing around with teh code i broke something and have been getting an error about tuple expected as output of generator.

I have an open quetsion on Stackoverflow looking to fix that script. 

As for the requirmenst of thsi project I beleiev this answers teh remaing quetions. If I had more time to focus on thsi I would try and git the car to drive smoother, and predict the center of teh lane and then train teh model with taht as anouther input. Thsi I beleiev would help the car drive in a wider verieity of tracks and real world variations. 

In this project, you I use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. I  trained, validated and tested a model using Keras. The model  output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle and drove it around the first track..(Secound track pending more work).

I used a simulator where you can steer a car around a track for data collection. If someone else wants to use thsi I will add the simulator ink on a website and link to Udacity's repo aswell. The simulator uses image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.

Check out the [writesave a fliped imgp template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3/blob/master/writeup_template.md) for this project and use it as a starting point for creating your own writeup. The write up is included as a markdown file for the istrutors to reveiw. 

This README file describes how to output the video in the "Details About Files In This Directory" section.

Creating a Great Writeup
---
A great writeup should include the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) as well as your description of how you addressed each point.  You should include a detailed description of the code used (with line-number references and code snippets where necessary), and links to other supporting documents or external references.  You should include images in your writeup to demonstrate how your code works with examples.  

All that said, please be concise!  We're not looking for you to write a book here, just a brief description of how you passed each rubric point, and references to the relevant code :). 

You're not required to use markdown for your writeup.  If you use another method please just submit a pdf of your writeup.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

The following resources can be found in this github repository:
* drive.py
* video.py
* writeup_template.md
* nvidia.py 
* nicholas_writeup
* nivida01.h5
* working-lap.mp4 : Video of completed lap 

The simulator can be downloaded from the classroom. In the classroom, we have also provided sample data that you can optionally use to help train your model.

## Details About Files In This Directory

### `drive.py`

Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`. See the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) for how to create this file using the following command:
```sh
model.save(filepath)
```

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

Note: There is known local system's setting issue with replacing "," with "." when using drive.py. When this happens it can make predicted steering values clipped to max/min values. If this occurs, a known fix for this is to add "export LANG=en_US.utf8" to the bashrc file.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument, `run1`, is the directory in which to save the images seen by the agent. If the directory already exists, it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

```

The image file name is a timestamp of when the image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Creates a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be the name of the directory followed by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally, one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 60
```

Will run the video at 60 FPS. The default FPS is 60, but you can chnage it. 

#### Why create a video

1. It's been noted the simulator might perform differently based on the hardware. So if your model drives succesfully on your machine it might not on another machine (your reviewer). Saving a video is a solid backup in case this happens.
2. You could slightly alter the code in `drive.py` and/or `video.py` to create a video of what your model sees after the image is processed (may be helpful for debugging).
